# SDC_new_issues_CRSP
I provide python code to link SDC platinum new issues data and CRSP daily fillings data. 

I followed work form Michelle Lowry, Roni Michaely, Ekaterina Volkova August 15, 2017. 
The documnet Online Appendix: Extraction and Cleaning of IPO Data from SDC Platinum only provides R codes. 
This would be a good reference to help match SDC data and CRSP data. 

I also verified my results with professor Jay R. Ritter's Initial Public Offerings: Updated Statistics.
